 -fetch new data just in time as user scroll
 more efficient than fetching all data at once


 Fetch new data when...
 user click a button
 or user scroll to certain points on the page 

 useInfiniteQuery --- hook
 Require diffrent API format than pagination


 pagination: 
 track current page in compoent state
 new query updates page number

 useInfiniteQuery tracks next query:
 -- next query is returend as part of the data



 // Bi driectional scrolling

 -- It is useful when starting is middle
 -- All next method and properties have equivalent for previous
